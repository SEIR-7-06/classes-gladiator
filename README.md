![are you not entertained](./assets/entertained.gif)

The Emperor has commissioned you to build a Gladiator Arena!! You'll be using your newfound ability to create ES6 classes to help them out. The Emperor has also provided some handy tests for you, written in Mocha and Chai, to help you know when you'll be done...

## ðŸš€ Before you start...

- Open up `gladiator/index.html`! You'll see some tests!
- You'll be working in both `gladiator.js` and `arena.js`. 
- If you can't figure out one of the steps, try writing some pseudocode in a comment in your file. You never know, it may come to you...
- You can also take a look at the tests to see if you get any hints that way...
- Check out the instructions in [gladiator/README.md](./gladiator/README.md)!

### ðŸš€ Completion looks like...

- All your tests are green!
