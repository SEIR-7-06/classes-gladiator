Hint!! These should give you a pretty good overview of what you need to do, but the tests are more descriptive.

## Part 1 - The Gladiator

In `gladiator.js`, create a `Gladiator` class that has the following properties:

- a `name`
- a `weapon` (one of Spear, Club, Trident)

The properties should be passed into the class when it is created.

> Ideally the Gladiator class shouldn't accept anything as a weapon except the strings `Spear`, `Club`, and `Trident`... head on down to [the bonus](#bonus-) if you want to tackle that now.

## Part 2 - The Arena

In `arena.js`, create an `Arena` class that meets the following conditions:

1. An arena has a name. This is passed in when the class is created.
2. The name should be capitalized.
3. An arena can have gladiators. This is initialized as an empty array.
4. You can add a gladiator to the arena.
5. The arena should never have more than 2 gladiators in it at a time.
6. If there are two gladiators in the arena, you can call a `fight` method that results in the elimination of one of the gladiators from the arena.
  - Winning conditions:
    - Trident beats Spear
    - Spear beats Club
    - Club beats Trident
    - If the two gladiators have the same weapon, they are both eliminated.
  - (If you're having a rough time thinking through this, just think about Rock Paper Scissors...)


##  Bonus!!!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

- Add a method to remove gladiators from the arena by name
- Update your winning conditions so that if the gladiator named "Maximus" is in the fight, he wins.
- Add a method to check to see if the crowd is entertained (`.entertained()`). The crowd is only entertained if Maximus is in the arena.

## âœ¨ Double Bonus!!!!!!!! âœ¨

How could you prevent creating Gladiators with a different weapon? e.g. `new Gladiator('J','Taco')` throws an error. (Maybe [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) has something to say about this...)

What other types of errors can you think of?? Here's a few:
- What if you try to add something to an arena's gladiators that's not an object created with the `Gladiator` class?
- What if you try to run the `fight` method without two gladiators in the arena?
